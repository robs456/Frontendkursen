    <h2>Some Lyrics</h2>
    
    <p>Face down in the gutter won't admit defeat <br>
        Though his clothes are soiled and black<br>
        He's a big strong man with a child's mind<br>
        Don't you take his booze away, hey<br>
        He's been at it for years drinkin' balls and beers<br>
        He's a hero to most he meets<br>
        But inside he cries black<br>
        Swollen eyes this man he sheds no tears<br>
        Now his wife and kids sing a different tune<br>
        As they worry about their daddy dyin'<br>
        But this arrogant fool breaks every rule<br>
        It'll be nothing but pride that kills him<br>
        Could he listen, no he won't that's all she wrote<br>
        He'll be dead before the daylight shines<br>
        'Cause the thoughts and prayers of a million strong<br>
        Might keep this boy from dying<br>
        Could he listen, no he won't that's all she wrote<br>
        He'll be dead before the daylight shines<br>
        'Cause the thoughts and prayers of a million strong<br>
        Might keep this boy from dying<br>
        He's a legend in the bar with every scar<br>
        Fights a thousand bigger men<br>
        Now he fights and looses got all the bruises<br>
        Will someone please step in?<br>
        This Irish fools got a great big heart<br>
        He keeps climbing back into the ring<br>
        In the low down circles where he holds his court<br>
        This man he once was king<br>
        Could he listen, no he won't that's all she wrote<br>
        He'll be dead before the daylight shines<br>
        'Cause the thoughts and prayers of a million strong<br>
        Might keep this boy from dying<br>
        Could he listen, no he won't that's all she wrote<br>
        He'll be dead before the daylight shines<br>
        'Cause the thoughts and prayers of a million strong<br>
        Might keep this boy from dying<br>
        This one goes out to everyone at six fifty six Adams street<br>
        How you doin'? Fellas<br>
        He's a legend in the bar with every scar<br>
        Fights a thousand bigger men<br>
        Now he fights and looses got all the bruises<br>
        Will someone please step in?<br>
        This Irish fools got a great big heart<br>
        He keeps climbing back into the ring<br>
        In the low down circles where he holds his court<br>
        This man he once was king<br>
        Could he listen, no he won't that's all she wrote<br>
        He'll be dead before the daylight shines<br>
        'Cause the thoughts and prayers of a million strong<br>
        Might keep this boy from dying<br>
        Could he listen, no he won't that's all she wrote<br>
        He'll be dead before the daylight shines<br>
        'Cause the thoughts and prayers of a million strong<br>
        Might keep this boy from dying</p>
